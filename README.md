# A-tunable-spacer-PAM-offset-expands-the-programmability-of-Cas9-cleavage
This project focuses on the study of CRISPR/Cas9 reprogramming with spacer and PAM separated. It examines the cutting activity and the changes in cutting sites, and uses smFRET to explore the underlying mechanism and its potential application in cells.

## 🛠️ System Requirements & Runtime Dependencies

The downstream computational pipelines and statistical scaling models are implemented and validated using R (version 4.2.0 or higher).
Required Packages
Run the following initialization block within your R console to establish the environment dependencies:
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "VennDiagram", "ggVennDiagram", "patchwork", "scatterplot3d"))
tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, stringr) - Core data manipulation and matrix operations.
ggVennDiagram / VennDiagram - Cross-batch intersection quality control for library replicability.
scatterplot3d - Projecting duplicate trends to inspect chimera noise convergence.
patchwork - Multi-panel alignment for multi-gRNA array configurations.

## 🚀 Quick Start Examples

1. Upstream Alignment Pipeline
cd 01_upstream_pipeline/
bash 01_alignment_and_analysis.sh <forward_reads.fastq.gz> <reverse_reads.fastq.gz>

### 2. In Vitro Cleavage Site Statistical Profiling
The mutation extraction and CIGAR parsing script lives under `02_fig1_cleavage_sites_statistical/`. It loops recursively through a parent folder to identify and parse all target `result.txt` tables:
```bash
cd 02_fig1_cleavage_sites_statistical/
# Replace <parent_data_directory> with the actual path containing your subfolders
Rscript findcutsiterepairCigarOtofRBatch.R <parent_data_directory>
3. Random Library Decoding
cd 03_fig3_random_library/
Rscript 01_library.R <path_to_replicate_1.txt> <path_to_replicate_2.txt> <path_to_replicate_3.txt>

4. Cellular InDel pattern Aggregation
cd 04_cellassay_statistical/
Rscript 01_InDel_pattern.R
